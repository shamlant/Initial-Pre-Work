# TG-Pre-Work

### While we do want our developers to work smarter, not harder, please refrain from plagiarizing.  It is completely fine to reword information you have gleaned from internet sources, however, please be prepared to redo the work should you submit a directly copied/pasted answer.  If you must copy/paste, cite your sources (this citation doesn't need to be fancy - just state directly where you found the information or provide a link).  Additionally, some of the questions below are tricky.  The answers were not necessarily covered in the reading we assigned.  They are not intended to be straightforward because we expect you to do some research to discover the answers to the best of your ability.  If you cannot find an answer, explain what you do know and what you are stuck on.  

## When we hit  https://www.techtonic.com/  what happens? Don’t focus too much on architecture (Monolithic, SOA, Microservices, etc.). Try to focus more on how the web functions in general terms/steps.
My request for the web page https://www.techtonic.com is send through the browser and connects to the server which holds all of the website databases information of the website and other websites.

## From start to finish, how does data reach you to be rendered in the browser?
Every website have its own IP address that is assigned to that specific website, when I hit  https://www.techtonic.com/ its IP address is sent through the network like a highway sorta of a system and connects to a server. Once the connection happen it locates the IP address with all the information about the website on the server, then the information is send back through the same highway system and the website is display in my browser on my computer.

## What code is rendered in the browser?
Rendered is the display of visual representation of HTML and CSS and interpreted them to a web page.

## What is the server-side code’s main function?
It receives the requested webpage information from the client-side and validate the requested information of the data, to make sure the correct data is being sent back to the client.

## What is the client-side code’s main function?
If I need to view a webpage I take action by requesting which webpage I want to view and search it in the browser. The browser uses JavaScript to display the webpage information into my browser.

## What is runtime?
Its the time when the program is running during web browsing until the user click the x to exit out of the web page.

## How many instances of the client-side assets (HTML, CSS, JS, Images, etc.) are created?
The effective client-side scripting can significantly reduce the server load. It is designed to run as a scripting language utilizing a web browser as a host program. For example, when a user makes a request via browser for a webpage to the server, it just sent the HTML and CSS as plain text, and the browser interprets and renders the web content in the client end.

## How many instances of the server-side code are available at any given time?
The server-side code are available at any given time when the client requests to access a web page.

It depends on the capabilities of the server and the resource needs for the workloads of the databases.
