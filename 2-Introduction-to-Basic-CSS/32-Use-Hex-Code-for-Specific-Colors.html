<!-- I can use 6 hexadecimal digits to represent colors, two each for the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components. 
  For example, #000000 is black and is also the lowest possible value. You can find more information about the RGB color system here


<style>
  body {
    background-color: #000000;
