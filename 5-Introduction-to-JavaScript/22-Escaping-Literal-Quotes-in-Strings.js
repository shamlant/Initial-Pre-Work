/* When you are defining a string you must start and end with a single or double quotes.
In JavaScript, I can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.*/

var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"."; // Change this line
